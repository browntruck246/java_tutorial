Let's break down the selected code:

```java
List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
```

### Explanation

1. **List<Product>**:

   - This declares a variable named `products` of type `List` that will hold `Product` objects.
   - `List` is an interface in Java that represents an ordered collection (also known as a sequence). It allows duplicate elements and provides positional access and insertion of elements.

2. **products**:

   - This is the name of the variable that will store the list of `Product` objects.

3. **new ArrayList<>()**:
   - This creates a new instance of `ArrayList` that will be assigned to the `products` variable.
   - `ArrayList` is a concrete implementation of the `List` interface. It uses a dynamic array to store the elements, which allows for fast random access and efficient resizing.

### Key Points

- **Type Safety**: By specifying `Product` in `List<Product>`, you ensure that only `Product` objects can be added to this list, providing type safety.
- **Initialization**: The `ArrayList` is initialized as an empty list, ready to have `Product` objects added to it.

### Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how you might use this list:

```java
// Create a new product list
List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();

// Add products to the list
products.add(new Product("Product1", 10.99));
products.add(new Product("Product2", 15.49));

// Iterate over the list and print product names
for (Product product : products) {
    System.out.println(product.getName());
}
```

In this example:

- We create a new `ArrayList` of `Product` objects.
- We add two `Product` objects to the list.
- We iterate over the list and print the names of the products.

This code snippet demonstrates how to initialize, add to, and iterate over a list of `Product` objects in Java.
